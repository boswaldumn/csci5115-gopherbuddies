# CSCI5115 - UI Design, Implementation, & Evaluation
This repository is our final project for CSCI5115 at the University of Minnesota. My group and I created the application 'Gopherbuddies' on Android Studio. You can read more about the project below.

# Gopherbuddies Project
This application was built in Android Stuido Code as our final project. The class was tasked to identify a problem to solve in the world today and be able to conduct a user research study of the targeted audience. Our group recognized the importance of making connections within your classes and the value of collaborating with peers. However, it is not always the easiest to find someone you would feel comfortable working with in a large classroom setting. Furthermore, we felt the switch to online classes as a result of the pandemic made this problem even more challenging as you do not get the same face to face interactions with other students. We wanted to create

This led us to ask the question: How might we create a resource for students to build connections outside of the classroom?

To figure out an answer to this question, we chose to conduct interviews with 6 different students and recent graduates to learn more about what they found challenging about creating academic connections and what resources they may have found helpful. These interviews also gave us insight into different work and study habits that students have. So once the interviews had been completed, we read through the interview transcripts and open-coded any important comments or things that stood out to us. Then, we compiled and compared all the codes from all 6 interviews for analysis and began extracting themes that seemed to be a common experience among the students we had interviewed.

First, we noticed that every student had different ways of studying and had different preferences based on what they found most effective. Many also expressed that they had instances where they did not enjoy working with a certain classmate due to a difference in work habits. Because of this, we wanted to make sure that our app would allow students with similar academic preferences to meet one another.

Second, we noticed that students really valued the flexibility that came from the switch to online classes. Being able to attend class remotely, or in some cases even watch lectures asynchronously were widely appreciated across our interviews.

Third, we found that students did not want any academic connections to feel forced and many expressed that finding people they are comfortable working with was the key to being productive. Overall, this idea of forming organic connections was much more appealing to students.

Finally, we noticed a pattern that not all students felt comfortable asking questions publicly in a classroom setting. We learned that if the option to ask questions anonymously was available, many students may feel more comfortable seeking the help they need

From these common themes, our group used IDEO-style brainstorming to generate as many ideas for our app as possible. We were left with 77 ideas which we then sorted through to eliminate bad ideas and then formed clusters of similar ideas using qualitative analysis methods resulting in a few core feature ideas.

We then as a group looked through these clusters to decide which feature ideas we believed to be the most effective and useful. The four we ultimately decided on are as follows:

First, we decided we need customizable user profiles where students can choose their
preferences for things such as study habits, preferences on where they study, their availability and more.

Second, we think it would be nice for there to be an algorithm that determines which student profiles might have the most compatibility to be good study buddies, and match those students with one another.

Third, we felt there should be a variety of communication features to support different study habits. Direct messaging, group chats, class forums, voice chats and more have all been discussed.

Last, we thought it would be nice to provide integration of commonly used services into the app. University data about class schedules could be automatically generated into the app, and students could display a Google Calendar on their profile, or link to their private Zoom room.
